Developing a prototype moderator for my family's chicken coup; using an embedded system of sensors such as a photoresistor, Sonar sensors, water level detection, and utilizing servos for mechanical action.
Implemented a dual-core system in the Raspberry Pi with one core managing sensors and the other running a WiFi server.
